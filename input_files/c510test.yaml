# list of the layers
# ####################
# the first one is the core, the last one is the medium
# order matters (obviously)
layers:
# each layer starts with "- "
# after "-" material type, range or other attributes are listed
# "attributes" is the optional field
# here you can put information on whether to use corrections to noble metal dielectric function
# or whether the layers contains dipole
# you can have only one dipole defined
- attributes:
  - size correction
  - nonlocal correction
# "material" is obligatiory field
# material name should be in the file pkg_resources/materials.yaml
  material: gold
# "range" is obligatory field only for layers that are not medium
# units are nm
  range:
    every: 1.0
    from: 7.5
    to: 7.5
- material: nhex
  range:
    every: 1.0
    from: 10.0
    to: 10.0
# here is example of medium layer with the dipole
- attributes:
  - dipole:
      range:
        every: 1.0
        from: 0.5
        to: 2.5
  material: etoh
# maximum order of expansion of VSH
# it can be later truncated if becomes non-convergent
max order of expansion: 20
# temperature of the system
# this modifies dielectric functions of metal (if defined in pkg_resources/mat_sizecor.yaml)
# dielectric constant of the solvent due to contraction (if defined in pkg_resources/mat_tempcor.yam)
# temperature is in Kelvins
temperature: 298.0
# how many points for integration of incoming field in theta angle
theta: 360
# wavelength range of incoming and outcoming radiation (should cover emission of the chosen fluorophores)
# most of the refractive indices are up to 850 nm
# the units are nm
wavelength:
  every: 1.0
  from: 440.0
  to: 640.0
